### <center> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ </center>
### I introduce myself as an AI passionate with a knack for numbers. I'm an Engineer in Applied Math, specializing in AI. 
Currently, I'm kicking it as an AI Consultant ðŸ”­ where I get to play with Data Science and lead projects that solve real-world problems using AI magic.

What fires me up? AI and new tech! 
My GitHub is like my secret lab where I unleash all sorts of personal projects. It's my playground where I get to experiment, tinker, and let my imagination run wild. I mean, who says work can't be fun, right?

Watching how AI can transform industries and make the world a better place? That's the stuff that gives me an extra skip in my step.

But here's the deal, it's not just about being a tech whiz. I'm all about building connections and creating a chill, collaborative vibe. Teamwork and good vibes? Count me inðŸ˜‰! 
So, if you're after an AI enthusiast who knows their stuff but also knows how to have a laugh, look no further.

I'm pumped to take on new AI adventures and explore uncharted territories together. Let's shake things up in the world of AI and create a future where technology kicks butt in the best way possible. Can't wait to geek out with you!
