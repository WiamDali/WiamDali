### AI passionate with a knack for numbers. 
I'm an  Applied Math. Engineer, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. 
Currently, I'm kicking it as an AI Consultant 👨🏻‍🏫 where I get to play with Data Science and lead projects that solve real-world problems using AI magic 🪄.

What fires me up? AI and new tech! 

My GitHub is  my secret lab where I unleash all sorts of personal projects. It's my playground where I get to experiment🧪, tinker, and let my imagination 💭 run wild. I mean, why not?

Watching how AI can transform industries and make the world a better place? That's the stuff that gives me an extra skip in my step.

But here's the deal, it's not just about being a tech whiz. I'm all about building connections and creating a chill🍻, collaborative vibe. Teamwork and good vibes ? Count me in😉! 

So, if you're after an AI enthusiast who knows their stuff but also knows how to have a laugh, look no further.

I'm pumped to take on new AI adventures and explore uncharted territories together. Let's shake things up in the world of AI and create a future where technology kicks butt in the best way possible. Can't wait to geek out with you!
